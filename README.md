# BrickNotes ðŸŽµ

**Build your sound!**  

BrickNotes is an interactive web-based music tool designed to help musicians, enthusiasts, and developers experiment with piano components, chords, scales, and negative harmony. Developed as part of a Web Development class at **PUC-Campinas**, this project combines commonly used technologies and interesting music theory concepts to deliver a cool user experience.

## Project Concept

BrickNotes is a tool that focuses on **interactive music theory exploration**. Users can:

- Visualize and play piano notes dynamically.
- Build and explore chords and scales.
- Generate **negative harmony** transformations based on a selected axis.
- Experiment with different music ideas in an intuitive, visual, and auditory manner.

---

## Features

1. **Dynamic Piano Component**  
   - Interactive piano with customizable note highlighting.
   - Scalable SVG model for rendering.

2. **Chord and Scale Generator**  
   - Generate and display chords/scales with playback.
   - Highlight notes dynamically based on user selections.

3. **Negative Harmony Exploration**  
   - Select an axis of reflection to generate negative chords/scales.
   - Visualize results on the piano.

4. **Audio Playback Modes**  
   - Play chords as harmonic blocks.
   - Play arpeggios.

5. **Responsive Design**  
   - Responsive interface using **Bootstrap**.
   - Cool animations.

6. **Technologies Integration**  
   - Interactive scrolling animations powered by **AOS**.
   - Dynamic note playback using JavaScript audio API.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based architecture for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: Framework for styling and responsive design.
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: Library for adding scrolling animations.

### Audio
- **HTML5 Audio API**: For dynamically loading and playing note audio files.

### Other Tools
- **SVG Models**: Used for rendering the piano component.
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration.
- **GitHub**: Repository hosting and documentation.

## Core Logic and Mechanisms

### Piano Rendering
- A scalable SVG-based piano renders the keyboard dynamically.
- Each key is associated with an ID, enabling real-time interaction and highlighting.

### Chord/Scale Generator
- Algorithms process user-selected notes and generate corresponding chords/scales.
- Data is mapped to values (0â€“11 for Câ€“B) to simplify calculations.

### Negative Harmony
- Implements **note reflection** around a user-selected axis (e.g., Dâ™¯/Eâ™­ as axis of symmetry).
- Calculates mirrored notes and displays results on the piano.

### Audio Playback
- Notes are mapped to `.mp3` files (e.g., `c4.mp3`) stored locally.
- **Chord Mode**: All selected notes play simultaneously.
- **Arpeggio Mode**: Notes play sequentially with a configurable delay.
